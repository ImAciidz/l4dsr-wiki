# üåø Choose your own adventure

There are **two** main ways you can contribute directly to the wiki.

### [üç§ The shrimple way](easy-way)

This option lets you work entirely within the browser, meaning you don't need to install anything. **The main downside** is that you cannot preview the site as you're editing the source.

Go with this method if you only want to edit some existing text or add videos into placeholders for them.

### [‚å® The hackerman way](hard-way)

This option includes a lot more setup. You'll need to install a handful of programs to let you sync your local changes and get a local preview of the site up and running.

Go with this option if you want to add new text and segments, change the formatting of the text, add new pages or change the look of the site.
